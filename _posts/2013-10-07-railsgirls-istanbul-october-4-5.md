  This weekend we have attended a very nice event called **Railsgirls**.
  This is an international event which is started in **Finland**.
  Main concept was to give an idea about programming web applications with 
  **Ruby on Rails** to women. That's why it is called Railsgirls!

We as **webBox** was one of the supporters to this lovely event. We arrived to 
location on Friday and brought our roll-up banner and brochures. The installation 
of development environment has already started to the girls’ laptops when we 
arrived there. Also a little welcome party was in progress!

On Friday, I met with [Jan Kus](http://twitter.com/koos). He is from Cologne / Germany. One of the Rails
Coaches. After we chat a little, we’ve found many mutual friends from Demoscene
world! That was really great! He is one of the co-founders of [RailsLove.com](http://railslove.com)
company. Also, [Öngün Eryılmaz](http://twitter.com/ongunella),
[Liane Thönnes](http://twitter.com/liane_thoennes) and [Tatjana Lajendäcker](http://twitter.com/schlafturbine)
were coming from Germany for Railsgirls İstanbul too...

The real event was the following day which was Saturday. I **(Uğur Özyılmazel)** 
brought two talented PHP programmers (**Caner Türkmen** and **Erdem Ertüzün**) with me.
I wanted to show them other technologies besides PHP.

Another great thing about this event was [Skroutz](http://skroutz.gr/). I did not know that
one of the main organizers of [Euroko](http://euruko2013.org/) is a member of Skroutz team.
It was great to meet [Fotos Georgiadis](http://twitter.com/gfotos)! Also met with Akilas Marousis too!

We presented [webBox.io](http://webbox.io) to attendants with a short-slide. 
Teams are already gathered and started to work!. I forgot to mention,
there were lovely breakfast and drinks too!

It was around **14:30** and I presented `git` to attendants. This was very simple
and introductory level presentation to `git`; “What is version controlling?"
"What is distributed source code management?" and so on.

After another great lunch, they kept working on. There were other presentations like

  - What is Bento Box?
  - What is a web design?
  - How did baby care make a better programmer?
  - Being a female developer
  - How to start your own business in Turkey?

[devPod](http://devpod.tumblr.com/) podcast crew was there and did many interviews with the people. 
We left little bit earlier, therefore we couldn’t attend the after party. 
Overall, this was a great meeting and a workshop. We are really proud to be a part of it.

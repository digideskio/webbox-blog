As [webBox.io](http://webbox.io) is a Ruby shop, we are all long time Rails users. And we really love **Ruby** and **Rails**.  We always seek ways to spread the Ruby love and give back to this great community. In this light we have supported [Rails Girls Istanbul](http://railsgirls.com/istanbul) and [Rails Girls Ankara](http://railsgirls.com/ankara) in Turkey, both beginners workshops to web development.

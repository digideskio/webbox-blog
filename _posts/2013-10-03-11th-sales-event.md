We as [webBox.io][1] attended our first official meeting to introduce our company.
Not only we achieved to introduce webBox.io, we also introduced our 
other initiative ["Funky Robots"][2].

We got together at our HQ in Seyrantepe. **Uğur Özyılmazel**, **Tunç Dindaş**, 
**Erman Akçay** and **Ali Sırmabıyık** left our office around 18:15 to go to 
Sun Plaza in Maslak where the meeting would take place.

When we arrived Sun Plaza / Sunplus, **Ümit Ünker** and his colleague **Burak Adalı**
welcomed us. **Mr. Ünker** was the organizer of this event and invited us 
personally to attend the meeting.

This meeting was specifically organized for us. Before the meeting, the 
[webBox.io][1] and [Funky Robots][2] teams sat at Starbucks to discuss and brainstorm 
a little more about our game plan at the meeting.

The participation was quite good. There wasn’t much of a crowd but it was a 
well-chosen one to be honest. In total, there were around 20 people from
different professions. Mr. Özyılmazel did his presentation about webBox.io
and Funky Robots after a brief introduction by Mr. Ünker.

After the presentation, the participants had free time to talk to other
participants and exchange business cards. This was a great opportunity for networking.

Following the networking time, all the participants got together for a group 
photo in the **Da Vinci Auditorium** using one of the applications developed
by the Funky Robots team. It’s called [Super Noir Camera][3].

After the group photo, all the participants promised each other that they would 
meet again at another meeting or training and they left the event hall.

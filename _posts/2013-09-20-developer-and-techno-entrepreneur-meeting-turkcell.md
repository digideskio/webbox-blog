  Today, we’ve attended a very special meet-up at Turkcell. This was a
  brief introduction to their latest service called : 
  [Geleceği Yazanlar](http://gelecegiyazanlar.turkcell.com.tr/)

---

This is a kind of service that helps Turkish speaking developers to learn
mobile development which includes iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Turkcell’s API.

It’s like lighter version of [Codeschool][1] but we believe this project will
grow very fast!. Site has also social features. You can connect with
your friends, win badges, attend challenges.

Mrs Sezin Mızraklı Güven made the welcome speech, introduced project outline and
its goals. After this, Mr Görkem Çetin has made a small demonstration
about how the system works.

**Görkem** explains the project and gives some internal statistics. Turkcell
also provides database backend with [UserGrid](http://usergrid.com). They provide
**1 million** rows per month as free of charge! They provide iOS, Android,
JavaScript, Node.js, Ruby and C# drivers.

After Görkem, Mr Alaaddin Alpay explained how Turkish Partnership Network works.
They asked about our ideas, how to develop more features and provide more
valuable services for users.

We as webBox, really enjoyed this event. Met new people and enhanced our
professional network. We believe there will be more of these events in
the future.
